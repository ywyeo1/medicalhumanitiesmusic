# Simcheongga

Simcheongga is a pansori (traditional Korean narrative music) that tells the story of Sim Cheong, who sacrifices herself by becoming an offering to the sea gods in exchange for 300 sacks of rice to help her blind father regain his sight. After being resurrected and becoming an empress, Sim Cheong reunites with her father, who ultimately recovers his vision.
Centered on the theme of filial piety, Simcheongga has been beloved by people of all ages and social classes throughout Korea.
Today, Simcheongga is preserved and performed through various styles, such as the Jeong Eung-min school, the Park Dong-sil school, the Kim Yeon-su school, the Kim So-hee school, and the Park Dong-jin school.
It is highly regarded for its well-organized narrative structure and outstanding dramatic composition.
The first half follows a tragic development leading to Sim Cheong’s death, while the latter half adopts a more humorous and festive tone, centering on Sim Bong-sa (her father).
