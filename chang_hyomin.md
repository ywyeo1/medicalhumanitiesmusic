# Me Before You

In Me Before You, the song "Not Today" by Imagine Dragons is used during the emotionally charged scenes where Will, the protagonist living with quadriplegia, prepares to say goodbye to Louisa and to his life. The soft, melancholic tone of the music, paired with lyrics about facing sorrow but not giving up easily, mirrors Will’s internal struggle — his love for Louisa and his painful decision to proceed with assisted suicide. Rather than directly emphasizing the physical limitations caused by his disability, the music captures the profound emotional weight of living with irreversible loss, helplessness, and the bittersweet nature of love and farewell. Through its restrained yet poignant atmosphere, "Not Today" helps the audience connect deeply with the character’s psychological and emotional world, portraying disability not just as a physical condition but as a complex human experience.
