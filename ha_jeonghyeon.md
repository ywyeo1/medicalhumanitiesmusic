# To Kill a Mockingbird

Elmer Bernstein’s main theme is composed of a simple and pure melody, symbolizing the innocence and helplessness of marginalized individuals, particularly Tom Robinson, who bears a physical disability. The music gently and poignantly embraces his innocence, quietly highlighting the vulnerability of characters placed before the heavy obstacle of societal prejudice. In To Kill a Mockingbird, the people in Maycomb believe Boo(nickname of Arthur Radley) is a threat, but the reality is that they misunderstand him because he falls somewhere on the autism spectrum, which medical professionals do not thoroughly grasp in the 1960's.
