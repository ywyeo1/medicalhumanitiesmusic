# Nymphomaniac

Seligman starts the conversation with, “It's something I've been listening to a lot lately.” and introduces Bach’s <Ich ruf zu Dir, Herr Jesu Christ>. He explains: “This piece has three voices: the bass voice, the second voice played with the left hand, and first voice played with the right hand. (…) And together, these three voices create the polyphony.”
Joe immediately maps her nymphomaniac experience onto this musical form. “Normally, a nymphomaniac is seen as... someone who can't get enough, and therefore, has sex with many different people. Well, that, of course, is true, but if I'm to be honest, I see it precisely as the sum of all these different sexual experiences. So in that way, I have only one lover.” She then describes three lovers—F, G and Jerome—in turn.
Joe explains that they correspond to the bass, middle, and upper voices, respectively. F, she says, was “monotonous, predictable, and ritualistic,” yet also “the foundation.” As she finishes this point, a single low phrase pulses beneath his frame. She continues: G was the only partner she both had to—and wanted to—wait for. He moved with jaguar-like grace and unpredictability, keeping her suspended between tension and release. When her account of him ends, a brief alto line floats over his image. She concludes with Jerome—“the secret ingredient to sex,” which, for her, is love. As she speaks, a rapid soprano run glides across the screen.
After each brief musical cue, the film pulls back into a split-screen montage: F on the left, G on the right, and Jerome in the center. At that moment, all three musical lines are heard together. The film synchronises the figures’ movements with the score, framing Joe’s claim—that many sexual experiences fuse into a single lover—in both sound and image. In doing so, the sequence depicts nymphomania not as simple addiction or promiscuity but as a complex inner order.
