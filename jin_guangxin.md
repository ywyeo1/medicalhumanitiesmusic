# A Silent Voice

Ani to Koe no Katachi (2016, directed by Naoko Yamada) is a poignant exploration of hearing impairment through the story of Shōko Nishimiya, a teenage girl navigating isolation and societal prejudice as her hearing gradually deteriorates. The film transcends mere disability representation by interweaving sensory dissonance with existential themes of human connection. Using innovative visual techniques—such as muted soundscapes and distorted close-ups—and minimalist sound design, it immerses viewers in Shōko’s fragmented perception of the world. A critique of societal indifference toward "invisible" disabilities, the narrative evolves into a meditation on empathy, communication, and the fragility of human bonds, elevated by the aesthetic sensibilities of Japanese art-house cinema.

Composed by Ken’ichi Nishio, the electronic score lit(var) serves as both a narrative device and emotional anchor. The track juxtaposes glitchy digital textures with organic melodies, mirroring Shōko’s fluctuating auditory experiences. Irregular rhythms and distorted frequencies evoke the disorientation of hearing loss, while sudden silences amplify the void left by silenced voices. A standout moment reinterprets a traditional Japanese folk melody through fragmented graphic equalization, symbolizing the clash between tradition and modernity in disability discourse. Nishio’s score transcends ambiance—it becomes a protagonist itself, translating sensory absence into visceral sonic poetry. By blurring boundaries between diegetic and non-diegetic sound, the music challenges listeners to confront their own perceptual biases, aligning with the film’s thesis on empathy as a bridge between sensory worlds.

The same disease is described in Sian Heder's 20121 film [*Coda*](yu_taehee.md). The film Joni Mitchell's hit song "Both Sides Now".
