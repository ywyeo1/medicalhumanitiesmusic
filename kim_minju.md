# The Theory of Everything

Richard Wagner is portrayed as the favorite comopser of the fillm's protagonist, Dr.Stephen Hawking. Wagner's music appears naturally throughout Stephen's life and helps highlight key moments in the film. In the case of Die Walküre Act 1: Vorspiel, the piece plays while Stephen is working on an assignment early in the film. During this scene, Stephen spills coffe, subtly foreshadwoing the difficulties he wil face later. In the case of Götterdämmerung: Siegfried’s Death and Funeral Music, it serves as the background music during a pivotal scene where Stephen, while attending a performance of Wagner’s Götterdämmerung at a theater in Bordeaux, begins coughing up blood. As the dramatic section of the piece plays, Stephen is carried out of the theater on a stretcher during the opera, and later, after undergoing an emergency tracheotomy due to respiratory failure, he survives but permanently loses his voice.
