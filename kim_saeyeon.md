# La Traviata

"Addio del Passato" is a song that Violeta sings with a feeling of death from tuberculosis, and her weak breath and thin melody delicately express her weak body and despair. Verdi portrays the flame of life that gradually disappears through a slow and breakable rhythm. The high notes conjure up passion and love of the past, but the silence and soft voice that follow emphasize her pain and resignation. The orchestra further highlights Violeta's loneliness and helplessness with minimal accompaniment. In this way, the music depicts sad and beautifully the process of a disease destroying not only the body but also the soul.
