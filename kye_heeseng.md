# Philadelphia

In Philadelphia (1993), directed by Jonathan Demme, music plays a powerful and emotional role, enhancing the film’s themes of injustice, compassion, and human dignity. The soundtrack uses both diegetic (heard by the characters) and non-diegetic (heard only by the audience) music to create a strong emotional connection to the story of Andrew Beckett (played by Tom Hanks), a lawyer who is fired from his firm because he has AIDS and is gay.

In one of the film’s most memorable scenes, Andrew plays Maria Callas’s recording of an aria from Andrea Chénier ("La mamma morta") for his lawyer Joe Miller (played by Denzel Washington). As the aria plays, Andrew translates the lyrics about suffering, death, and love, using the music to express feelings he otherwise cannot articulate. This sequence shows music’s ability to transcend words, revealing Andrew’s inner world and evoking Joe’s deeper empathy.
