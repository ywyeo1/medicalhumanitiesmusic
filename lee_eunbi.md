The song "All Love Can Be" features a gentle orchestral backdrop and a tender vocal performance that beautifully reflect the emotional core of the film. Its calm yet deeply expressive tone captures the invisible struggles Nash faces with schizophrenia, while also highlighting his unwavering hope and capacity for love. Rather than focusing on despair, the music gently portrays the resilience and quiet strength that define his character, offering a touching glimpse into the enduring power of human connection.
