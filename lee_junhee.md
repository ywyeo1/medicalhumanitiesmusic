# The Theory of Everything

The music delicately captures Stephen Hawking’s journey in coming to terms with the heavy fate of ALS. Especially through its soft and lyrical melody, it conveys complex emotions such as fear, solitude, and hope, which are difficult to express in words. The main theme symbolizes Hawking’s spirit, which continues to soar freely even as his body weakens. The music highlights the contrast between physical limitation and mental transcendence, amplifying the emotional impact. Through the music, the audience feels not just the illness but the unbreakable human spirit within it. Ultimately, music becomes not just a background element but a poetic language that expands the theme of disease. This musical approach leads us to reinterpret illness not merely as tragedy, but as another expression of humanity.
