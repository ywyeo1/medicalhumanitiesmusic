# Cheongseol(Hear Me)

 The film Cheongseol portrays hearing impairment not as a deficiency, but as a fullness of other senses. Through this lens, the film reveals a deeper sense of emotional connection and evokes quiet yet powerful emotions. The main theme song, Season (Gyejeol), delicately captures the emotional changes and mutual understanding shared by the protagonists in a world without sound. Sung by No Yoon-seo, portrayed as hearing-impaired, and her younger sister, played by Kim Min-ju, who also has a hearing impairment, the song features a gentle and warm melody that expresses how emotions and love remain vivid even in the absence of hearing. The piece conveys the message that even when sound is absent, emotions continue to flow. When Season plays in scenes without dialogue, it subtly reminds viewers that a life without sound is not necessarily empty. The music communicates the characters’ loneliness, pain, hope, and joy without needing spoken words, showing hearing loss not as a loss, but as the awakening of other senses. The soft progression of Season allows the audience to experience the beauty of connection in silence. In this way, Cheongseol portrays hearing impairment not as something to be overcome, but as an entry into a new emotional world through music.
