# A Silent of Voice

The piece ["Lit,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a57-KveTE84) featured in A Silent Voice, sonically embodies the protagonist's experience of an unstable world through soft and repetitive piano melodies. Rather than presenting a distinct rhythm or melody, the piece delicately arranges fragile and cautious tones to convey the isolation and disconnection felt in a soundless world. Notably, a characteristic feature observed throughout the A Silent Voice original soundtrack is the intentional inclusion of ambient noises. Upon close listening, one can hear sounds such as fingernails brushing against piano keys and mechanical noises from the instrument itself. These elements were deliberately incorporated by Kensuke Ushio, inspired by the characteristics of hearing aids. Since hearing aids amplify unnecessary ambient sounds along with voices, users often perceive sounds mixed with various kinds of noise. By intentionally embedding these imperfections into the music, Ushio allows listeners to experience sound from the perspective of a person with hearing impairment. This musical approach helps the audience directly empathize with the emotional isolation caused by hearing loss and reinterprets disability not merely as a physical condition but as a profound emotional experience.

A comparable example can be found in the film [*Silenced*](ryu_seungwon.md),  
which also deals with hearing impairment and uses music to portray emotional isolation and societal neglect.

> *[Silenced](ryu_seungwon.md)* likewise employs music to portray the pain of hearing-impaired individuals, though through a more somber, orchestral approach. Both works demonstrate how sound—or its intentional absence—can reflect emotional distance and highlight the importance of empathy and social awareness.

The piece I would like to have played at my funeral is Nuvole Bianche by ["Ludovico Einaudi"](https://youtu.be/4VR-6AS0-l4?si=5ow36NuWofA842H_). This composition carries deep emotion within a quiet and restrained atmosphere, which I feel closely reflects my own nature. I tend to approach life with rational thinking rather than openly expressing my emotions, and I try to maintain a sense of thoughtfulness in my relationships with others. I believe this music resonates with the quiet sincerity and depth that lie beneath the surface of who I am.

A funeral is a time when people gather to quietly share in remembrance and farewell. I believe this piece suits that atmosphere perfectly. Rather than provoking overwhelming sadness, it gently invites reflection on a life once lived, offering a sense of peace to those who remain. Through this music, I hope to be remembered with warmth and tranquility in my final farewell.

권혁빈은 25살. 군 복무를 마치고 복학을 앞두고 있는 대학생이다. 오랜만에 사회에 다시 나서면서 적응을 위해 영화관에서 아르바이트를 시작했고, 그곳에서 한 동료와 가까워졌다. 매일 인사하고, 같이 퇴근하고, 소소한 농담을 주고받으며 자연스레 호감이 쌓였다. 혼자 착각한 걸지도 모른다는 불안감도 있었지만, 그녀가 먼저 연락해줄 때면 마음이 움직이는 걸 막을 수 없었다.

하지만 어느 날, 그녀가 "요즘 썸 타는 사람 생겼다"며 들뜬 표정으로 얘기하던 순간, 혁빈은 내색하지 않고 웃었지만 속은 무너져내렸다. 그날 이후 영화관 유니폼을 입는 것도, 퇴근 후 집에 돌아오는 길도, 모두 어색하고 무거워졌다. 사람들과 어울리는 게 버겁고, 전역 후 다잡았던 자존감은 다시 바닥으로 떨어졌다. 무기력한 하루들이 이어졌고, 자꾸만 자신이 작아지는 느낌이 들었다.

그러다 우연히 극장 청소 중 흘러나오던 한 곡이 귓가에 남았다. 가사는 잘 들리지 않았지만, 멜로디에 담긴 공허함과 따뜻함이 이상하게도 마음에 박혔다. 그날 밤부터 혁빈은 밤마다 음악을 듣기 시작했고, "이런 감정을 겪은 사람이 나뿐은 아니구나"라는 생각에 위로를 받았다. 아직 감정은 요동치지만, 음악은 그에게 조금씩 숨 쉴 틈을 만들어주고 있었다.
