# Silenced

The main theme of the film "Silenced" employs a deep, heavy string melody to poignantly portray the pain experienced by hearing-impaired children and the societal silence surrounding their suffering. Rather than exaggerating the scenes, the music conveys sorrow with a restrained emotional tone, allowing the audience to engage more sincerely with the characters’ anguish. Through its somber and minimalist approach, the score deepens the emotional resonance of the film, emphasizing the gravity of the injustice and the need for awareness and change.
