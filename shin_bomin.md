# Silver Linings Playbook

"My Cherie Amour" serves as a trigger for Pat, bringing back memories of his ex-wife. Whenever he hears the song, he impulsively erupts in anger, clearly revealing the emotional regulation difficulties characteristic of bipolar disorder. The music symbolically illustrates how a specific stimulus can have a profound and immediate impact on someone with a mental illness. Through this, the film conveys that pathological reactions are not merely a lack of rationality, but are deeply tied to emotional scars.
