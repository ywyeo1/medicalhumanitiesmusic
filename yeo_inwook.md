# Navillera

In Navillera, Taemin’s “My Day” is more than just a song about chasing a dream — it quietly embraces the struggles of two people standing at different crossroads of life. For Deok-chul Sim, it becomes a warm light as he dares to revive a long-forgotten dream in the face of fading memories. For Chae-rok Lee, burdened by the uncertainty of his future, it echoes the quiet hopes he tries so hard to hold onto. As “My Day” gently flows through the story, it captures the shared longing of both characters: to keep walking toward something meaningful, even when the road ahead is blurred. The line, “Dream my dream, so that I can reach wherever, whatever,” becomes an encouragement for both the old man chasing a final wish and the young dancer struggling to find his path. In moments when life feels heavy and unsure, My Day wraps around them like sunlight, reminding them that it’s not too late to dream again.

Though the disease discussed is not the same as [*Keys to the Heart*](SeHyun-Moon.md), both explore how music functions as a medium of emotional expression beyond verbal communication. While Sim Deok-chul in *Navillera* uses dance and music to rekindle a dream that illness threatens to extinguish, Jin-tae in *Keys to the Heart* expresses his inner life through piano, despite his difficulty with verbal communication. Both characters find in music a space where they are free from the limitations imposed by their conditions.
